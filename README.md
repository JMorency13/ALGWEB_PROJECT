# Animated Algorithm Visualization Website
A personal project, making a simple website that shows animated displays of different algorithms, using html, javascript, and css. 

The web page, will show a simple menu of 4 different algorithm options. The user can select which algorithm to show a display of, a random animated display will be generated and is random each time. 

For each of the different algorithms, two main functions were made to draw the diagrams; the drawArray fucntion, which is used to draw the bars for the bubble sort and binary search algorithms. The visualizeGraph function is was made to create a tree; creating the nodes and edges and calculating the distance of the edges from one node to another and tracking the position of the nodes to have them in a cicular layout.

Once an algorithm visualization is complete, or when another algorithm option is chosen, the function clearVisualization will run and clear the current graph or array present. In the case of another algorithm being selected, once the old visualization is erased, the visualization function for the algorithm respective to the option selected will then begin to run.
